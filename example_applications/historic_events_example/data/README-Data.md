# Historic Events

This is a really cool data set of historic events scraped from wikipedia by
Dr. Daniel Hienert at the GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences.
He has a [web site](https://www.vizgr.org/) where you can view his research
and data.

We make no claims on the validity of this data but it is awesome to use for
test examples.

Thank you Dr. Daniel!
